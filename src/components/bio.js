				<h2>Hello, I’m Zak. I am a fullstack web developer, React fan, and API lover.</h2>
				<p>I am a recent graduate of Thinkful’s Front End Web Development bootcamp. I started coding so that I could be imaginative and see my designs take shape. I kept coding because I became addicted to the thrill of functional code, especially after strenuous debugging.</p> 
				<p>Away from my computer I am an avid runner, an aspiring cook, and DIY project enthusiast. I de-stress by romping around outside, playing indie videogames, or watching any B-list movie I can get my hands on.</p>
