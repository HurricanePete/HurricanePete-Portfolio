						<p>I started coding while working as a fixed-income credit analyst for a small financial tech company. It didn't take long for me to discover that I enjoyed building apps more than analyzing financial data or trolling the SEC website for documents.</p>
						<p>As a developer, I have built full stack applications using numerous JavaScript technologies, including React.js, Redux, Node.js, Mongoose, Passport, and jQuery. I also enjoy learning new CSS tricks to expand my arsenal and I'm addicted to the thrill of a successful debugging session or library integration.</p>
						<p>Away from my computer, I am an avid runner, an aspiring cook, and a DIY project enthusiast. I de-stress by romping around outside, playing indie video games, or watching any B-list movie I can get my hands on.</p>
